# Neural-Network
Neural network built from scratch

# Implementation of forward propagation
A neural network with two inputs, one hidden layer with three sigmoid neuron and one output neuron 

# Implementation of backward propagation
Partial deriation and numpy is used to calcualte error

# Implementation of Exclusive-OR (XOR)
A real life example to demonstrate the efficiency of three layer neural network.
